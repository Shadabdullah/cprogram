Here, c is a scalar variable that can store only a single value. However, you are already familiar with arrays that can hold multiple values of the same data type in a contiguously allocated memory block. So, you might wonder, can we have pointers to arrays too? Indeed, we can.

Let us start with an example code and look at its output. We will discuss its behavior subsequently.
