Exercise 1: Basic File I/O
Reading from a file: Write a program that reads integers from a file named input.txt, one integer per line, and prints them to the console.

Writing to a file: Modify the program to write these integers to a file named output.txt instead of printing them to the console.

Challenge 1: Categorizing Data
Reading and Categorizing: Write a program that reads integers from input.txt. If an integer is even, write it to a file named even.txt; if it is odd, write it to a file named odd.txt.

Passing Output: Write a second program that reads integers from both even.txt and odd.txt, and prints the contents of both files to the console.

Exercise 2: Processing and Writing Multiple Files
String Processing: Write a program that reads lines of text from input.txt. If a line contains the word "error", write it to a file named errors.txt; otherwise, write it to a file named log.txt.

Word Count: Write a program that reads log.txt, counts the number of words in each line, and writes these counts to a file named word_count.txt.

Challenge 2: Chaining Programs
First Program: Write a program that reads integers from input.txt, squares each integer, and writes the squares to a file named squares.txt.

Second Program: Write a second program that reads the integers from squares.txt, finds the prime numbers among them, and writes these primes to a file named primes.txt.
